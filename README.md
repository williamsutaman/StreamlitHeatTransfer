Heat Transfer Simulator for Simple Oil and Gas Wells

The current codes are still limited for multiphase fluid flow in production well case.
Inputs needed to run the simulator are general well data, fluid data, and thermal data.
Control volume in the back-end of the simulator is set at 100 ft for a reasonable calculation accuracy.
